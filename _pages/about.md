#Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a master's student in the [School of Control and Computer Engineering](http://example.com) at [North China Electric Power University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China_Electric_Power_University), currently pursuing my master's degree in Software Engineering. I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation in 2023, and my research thesis on fuzzy control was awarded the title of Excellent Graduation Thesis.

Currently, I am studying and conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Long Cheng](https://longcheng.eu/) in the [Distributed Systems Group](http://182.92.109.163/) he leads. My work focuses on performance optimization, and my current research areas include deep learning, cloud computing, and intelligent transportation systems.
