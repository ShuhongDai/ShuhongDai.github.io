I am a master's student in the [School of Control and Computer Engineering](https://cce.ncepu.edu.cn/) at [North China Electric Power University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_China_Electric_Power_University), pursuing my master's degree in Software Engineering. I received my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Automation in 2023 and my research thesis on fuzzy control was awarded the title of Excellent Graduation Thesis. Prior to this, I was interested in embedded real-time operating systems and efficient switch-mode power supply control. I have won several competition awards, such as the first prize in the university electronic design competition sponsored by Huawei in 2020 for designing a four-switch Buck-Boost circuit. In 2023, the "Dual-Car Following System" project I supervised won the highest award, the "TI Cup" sponsored by Texas Instruments, in the provincial undergraduate electronics design contest.

Currently, I am conducting research under the supervision of [Prof. Long Cheng](https://longcheng.eu/) in the [Distributed Systems Group](http://182.92.109.163/) he leads. My work focuses on performance optimization, and my research areas include deep reinforcement learning, cloud computing, and intelligent transportation systems.
